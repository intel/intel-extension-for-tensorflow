# Intel CPU Software Installation

## Hardware Requirements

Verified Hardware Platforms:
- 2nd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors.
- 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors.
- 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors.

## Software Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 (64-bit), Ubuntu 22.04 (64-bit) or CentOS Linux 8 (64-bit), and Sapphire Rapids requires Ubuntu 22.04 or CentOS Linux 8 with kernel version >= 5.16
- Python 3.8-3.10
- pip 19.0 or later (requires manylinux2014 support)

## Install via Docker container

#### Build Docker container from Dockerfile

Run the following [Dockerfile build procedure](./../../../docker/README.html) to build the pip based deployment container.

#### Get docker container from dockerhub

Pre-built docker images are available at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/intel-extension-for-tensorflow/tags).
Run the following command to pull the CPU Docker container image to your local machine.

```
$ docker pull intel/intel-extension-for-tensorflow:cpu
$ docker run -it -p 8888:8888 intel/intel-extension-for-tensorflow:cpu
```
Then go to your browser on http://localhost:8888/

## Install via PyPI wheel in bare metal

#### Install TensorFlow

The Python development and virtual environment setup recommendation by TensorFlow to isolate package installation from the system.

The Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* requires stock TensorFlow, and the version should be == 2.13.0.


##### Virtual environment install 

You can follow the instructions in [stock tensorflow install](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#step-by-step_instructions) to activate the virtual environment.

On Linux, it is often necessary to first update pip to a version that supports manylinux2014 wheels.
```bash
(tf)$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

To install in virtual environment, you can run 
```bash
(tf)$ pip install tensorflow==2.13.0
```

##### System environment install 
If you prefer install tensorflow in $HOME, append `--user` to the commands.
```bash
$ pip3 install --user tensorflow==2.13.0
``` 
And the following system environment install for Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* will also append `--user` to the command. 

#### Install Intel® Extension for TensorFlow*

To install a CPU-only version in virtual environment, you can run

```bash
(tf)$ pip install --upgrade intel-extension-for-tensorflow[cpu]
```

##### Verify the Installation 
```
python -c "import intel_extension_for_tensorflow as itex; print(itex.__version__)"
```
