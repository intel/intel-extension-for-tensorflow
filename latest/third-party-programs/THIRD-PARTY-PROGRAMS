      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

		  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		  subsequently incorporated within the Work.

		2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

		3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		  as of the date such litigation is filed.

		4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		  meet the following conditions:

		  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
			  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

		  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
			  stating that You changed the files; and

		  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
			  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
			  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
			  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
			  the Derivative Works; and

		  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
			  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
			  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
			  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
			  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
			  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
			  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
			  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
			  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
			  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
			  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
			  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
			  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
			  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
			  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
			  as modifying the License.

		  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		  the conditions stated in this License.

		5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

		6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

		7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

		8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

		9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation
	("PSF"), and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and
	otherwise using this software ("Python") in source or binary form and
	its associated documentation.

	2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
	grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to reproduce,
	analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative works,
	distribute, and otherwise use Python alone or in any derivative version,
	provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of copyright,
	i.e., "Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010,
	2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 Python Software Foundation; All Rights Reserved" are retained
	in Python alone or in any derivative version prepared by Licensee.

	3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on
	or incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make
	the derivative work available to others as provided herein, then
	Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of
	the changes made to Python.

	4. PSF is making Python available to Licensee on an "AS IS"
	basis.  PSF MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
	IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND
	DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
	FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF PYTHON WILL NOT
	INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

	5. PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON
	FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS
	A RESULT OF MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON,
	OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

	6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
	breach of its terms and conditions.

	7. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any
	relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and
	Licensee.  This License Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF
	trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote
	products or services of Licensee, or any third party.

	8. By copying, installing or otherwise using Python, Licensee
	agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License
	Agreement.

7.  pcre

	PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
	and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

	Releases 10.00 and above of PCRE2 are distributed under the terms of the "BSD"
	licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary
	redistributions. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory,
	is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the
	testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

	The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
	included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
	optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
	the library is built.

	EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
	------------------------------------------

	The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
	not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
	PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
	includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
	PCRE2 independently.

16. libjpeg-turbo

	libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:

	- The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
	  [README.ijg](README.ijg)

	  This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs
	  (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)

	- The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below

	  This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as
	  well as the build system.

	- The [zlib License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib)

	  This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
	  SIMD extensions.


	Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
	=========================================

	This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
	best of our understanding.

	1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
		then:

		1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
			from the source.

			**Origin**
			- Clause 1 of the IJG License
			- Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
			- Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License

		2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
			file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if
			there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
			simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

			**Origin**
			- Clause 1 of the IJG License
			- Clause 2 of the zlib License

		3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
			copyright or license text in that file.

			**Origin**
			- Clause 1 of the IJG License

	2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
		if you are distributing an application that statically links with
		libjpeg-turbo, then:

		1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

			This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
			Group.

			**Origin**
			- Clause 2 of the IJG license

		2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
			your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
			License (see below.)

			**Origin**
			- Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License

	3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
		contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

		**Origin**
		- IJG License
		- Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License

	4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
		free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
		consequences resulting from your use of the software.

		**Origin**
		- IJG License
		- Modified BSD License
		- zlib License


	The Modified (3-clause) BSD License

	  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation
	  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

	LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
	CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF
	SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS
	INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
	CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
	ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.


	Why Three Licenses?
	===================

	The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD
	License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution
	conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed
	libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG
	License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend
	attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was
	desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code
	that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.

18. jsoncpp

	The JsonCpp library's source code, including accompanying documentation,
	tests and demonstration applications, are licensed under the following
	conditions...

	Baptiste Lepilleur and The JsonCpp Authors explicitly disclaim copyright in all
	jurisdictions which recognize such a disclaimer. In such jurisdictions,
	this software is released into the Public Domain.

	In jurisdictions which do not recognize Public Domain property (e.g. Germany as of
	2010), this software is Copyright (c) 2007-2010 by Baptiste Lepilleur and
	The JsonCpp Authors, and is released under the terms of the MIT License (see below).

	In jurisdictions which recognize Public Domain property, the user of this
	software may choose to accept it either as 1) Public Domain, 2) under the
	conditions of the MIT License (see below), or 3) under the terms of dual
	Public Domain/MIT License conditions described here, as they choose.

	The MIT License is about as close to Public Domain as a license can get, and is
	described in clear, concise terms at:

	   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License

	The full text of the MIT License follows:

	========================================================================
	Copyright (c) 2007-2010 Baptiste Lepilleur and The JsonCpp Authors

	Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person
	obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation
	files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without
	restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy,
	modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies
	of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
	furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

	The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
	included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

	THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
	EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
	NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
	BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN
	ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN
	CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
	SOFTWARE.
	========================================================================
	(END LICENSE TEXT)

	The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial
	software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the
	minor nuisance of being required to keep the above copyright notice
	and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the
	Public Domain "license" you can re-license your copy using whatever
	license you like.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
19. eigen

    libeigen
	
	Eigen is primarily MPL2 licensed. See COPYING.MPL2 and these links:
	  http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/
	  http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html

	Some files contain third-party code under BSD or LGPL licenses, whence the other
	COPYING.* files here.

	All the LGPL code is either LGPL 2.1-only, or LGPL 2.1-or-later.
	For this reason, the COPYING.LGPL file contains the LGPL 2.1 text.

	If you want to guarantee that the Eigen code that you are #including is licensed
	under the MPL2 and possibly more permissive licenses (like BSD), #define this
	preprocessor symbol:
	  EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY
	For example, with most compilers, you could add this to your project CXXFLAGS:
	  -DEIGEN_MPL2_ONLY
	This will cause a compilation error to be generated if you #include any code that is
	LGPL licensed.
