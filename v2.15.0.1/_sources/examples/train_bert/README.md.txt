# BERT Training for Classifying Text on Intel CPU and GPU

## Introduction

Intel速 Extension for TensorFlow* is compatible with stock TensorFlow*. 
This example uses the tutorial from tensorflow.org [Classify text with BERT](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/classify_text_with_bert) to show training on BERT model without changing the original code.

Installing the Intel速 Extension for TensorFlow* in legacy running environment, TensorFlow will execute the training on Intel CPU and GPU.

**No need any code change**

## Hardware Requirements

Verified Hardware Platforms:
 - Intel速 Data Center GPU Max Series
 - Intel CPU
 
## Prerequisites

### Prepare for GPU (Skip this step for CPU)

Refer to [Prepare](../common_guide_running.html#prepare)

### Setup Running Environment


* Setup for GPU
```bash
./set_env_gpu.sh
```

* Setup for CPU
```bash
./set_env_cpu.sh
```

If your system is Ubuntu22.04, we suggest you to install below g++ version in conda environment.
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gxx_linux-64==12.1.0
```

### Enable Running Environment

1. Enable oneAPI running environment (only for GPU) and virtual running environment.

   * For GPU, refer to [Running](../common_guide_running.html#running)

   * For CPU, 
```bash
source env_itex_cpu/bin/activate
```

2. Install the Python packages used in [Classify text with BERT](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/classify_text_with_bert).

The Jupyter notebook script will install other required pacakges while it is running. So there's no need to pre-install them.

### Download Jupyter Code:

```
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow_docs/text/docs/tutorials/classify_text_with_bert.ipynb
```

## Startup Jupyter Notebook

```
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=./ --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser  --allow-root &
...

## Execute

1. Open classify_text_with_bert.ipynb by Jupyter notebook.

2. Run the tutorial according to the description in the Jupyter notebook.

3. The TensorFlow will train and infer the BERT model on Intel CPU or GPU.


## FAQ

1. The following error log is a known issue and it is not caused by Intel速 Extension for TensorFlow*. This crash happens when the code is finished and tries to release resources. It doesn't impact the result of the Bert training and inference/test.

``` Exception ignored in: <function _CheckpointRestoreCoordinatorDeleter.__del__ at 0x7fa167430d30>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/xxx/xxx/env_itex/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/tracking/util.py", line 174, in __del__
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

2. Jupyter ipython kernel crash after import tf2.14 in Ubuntu22.04 is a known issue. You can install below g++ version in conda environment to solve this problem.
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gxx_linux-64==12.1.0
```
