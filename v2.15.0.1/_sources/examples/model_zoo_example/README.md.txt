# Accelerate Deep Learning Training and Inference for Model Zoo Workloads on Intel GPU

## Introduction
This example shows the guideline to run Model Zoo workloads using TensorFlow* framework on Intel GPU with the optimizations from Intel速 Extension for TensorFlow*.

## Quick Start Guide

### Run Models in the Docker Container

- For Intel速 Data Center GPU Flex Series

    Refer to [AI Model Zoo Containers on Flex Series](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/containers/model-zoo-flex-series-containers.html) to run optimized Deep Learning inference workloads.

- For Intel速 Data Center GPU Max Series

    Refer to [AI Model Zoo Containers on Max Series](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/containers/model-zoo-max-series-containers/model-zoo-max-series-containers.html) to run optimized Deep Learning training and inference workloads.

### Run Models on Bare Metal

Refer to [AI Model Zoo Examples on Intel速 Data Center GPU](https://github.com/IntelAI/models/tree/master#intel-data-center-gpu-workloads) to run optimized Deep Learning training and inference workloads on bare metal.
